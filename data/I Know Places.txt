You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign, Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vulture circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out, it could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes, And we run
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places, I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes, And we run
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, My love
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof, I know places
(I) And you know for me it's always you, I know places
(I) In the dead of night, you're eyes so green, I know places
(I) And I know for you it's always me, I know places
